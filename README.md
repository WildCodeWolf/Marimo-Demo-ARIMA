# `marimo` Demo:  Stock price prediction

This repo contains a simple interactive website built from a [`marimo`](https://marimo.io) notebook.
It showcases `marimo`'s interactive capabilities by letting the viewer select parameters for a time
series prediction model and visualises the tweaks in real time.

The dataset itself is publicly available on https://www.openml.org/d/43424 and gets loaded dynamically
at runtime.  The app itself contains and explains more information.  Feel free to check it out.

To see it in action, visit https://WildCodeWolf.github.io/Marimo-Demo-ARIMA/.
